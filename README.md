  <strong>An Electromagnetic Motor built to learn crucial workshop practice skills</strong>
</p>

### Project Outline

This project involved designing and fabricating a custom electromagnetic motor, built entirely from scratch using a combination of digital fabrication and hands-on engineering techniques. The motor was powered by a 6V DC source and achieved rotational speeds of up to 1100 RPM, demonstrating both mechanical reliability and effective electromagnetic design.

The rotor and structural components were 3D printed, enabling precise alignment of the magnetic and mechanical systems. The motor base was hand-shaped using metal bending techniques, providing a sturdy foundation and solid electrical grounding. A laser-cut acrylic case was custom-designed to serve as a protective and display enclosure, enhancing both safety and presentation.

A custom PCB was soldered which featured a hall effect sensor the toggle the electromagnet and two LEDs to show if the motor was on, and if a magnetic field was sensed.
